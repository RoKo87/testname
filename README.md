Rohan, I haven't added any ids so you can use any naming system you would want. Also for the boolean variables (hypertension treatment, asprin treatment, diabetes, and smoker) I am not sure how to only allow one to be selected at a time. I think the can be solved with JS, also I know the style is a bit of but I will work on it sometime this week. Lastly, the css file I included only makes the secondary text of the answer boxes smaller, nothing else.
